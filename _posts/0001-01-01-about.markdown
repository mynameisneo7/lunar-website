Lunar is a rolling-release, source-based Linux distribution for advanced users.

You begin by installing the _lunar core,_ a minimal command-line only system, with the tools to build the full experience you want. From there, you create your own customized system built entirely from source code.

#### Stable
We use up-to-date software with very little changes from upstream.

#### Flexible
Our _lunar_ package management system is written entirely in Bash, and it's both powerful and easy to learn.

#### Fast
Hardware optimizations will make your system quick and responsive.

#### Bloat-free
Clear choices for optional dependencies will ensure a system that only contains what you ask for.

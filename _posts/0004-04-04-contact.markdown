*how do people talk to us? Right now there's IRC and an email(?).

The bigger discussion: the type of user we attract will have different ways of communicating. Lots of younger users don't use email - their email is a burner account for junk and registrations. Lot's of them don't know about IRC at all.  

Do we want a social media presence, like a Facebook page? Should we start a Discord server? A subreddit? All of those will make us more accessible, and might bring more interested users (and maybe help), but also require someone to be attentive to them.*

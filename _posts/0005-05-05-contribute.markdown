_I have no idea what the costs are to run Lunar. Do we need to seek donations?_

_What we need more than money is people willing to help out. Even if it's small work like version bumps, every person who can contribute makes it easier for the dev team to make larger improvements. However, adding helpers will increase the work requirements of the devs unless we get users who can be trusted to make dev level decisions. If more people appear, there will need to be discussions how to effectively share the work._

_sample text below:_

### Donate

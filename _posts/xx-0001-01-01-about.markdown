_This part is important - who are we trying to attract? Lunar can be good for many people, but we need a focus. Can beginners install and maintain Lunar? Do we want developers and sysadmins looking for detailed control over their system? Users with older computers looking to optimize their system? Distro hoppers looking for something new?_

_Do we explain what makes Lunar different from other distros? Are we a de-bloated version of Gentoo? Are we an advanced version of Linuxfromscratch?_

_sample text below:_

Lunar is a rolling-release, source-based Linux distribution for advanced users.

You begin by installing the _lunar core,_ a minimal command-line only system, with the tools to build the full experience you want. From there, you create your own customized system built entirely from source code.

#### STABLE
We use up-to-date software with very little changes from upstream.

#### FLEXIBLE
Our _lunar_ package management system is written entirely is bash, and it's both powerful and easy to learn.

#### FAST
Hardware optimizations will make your system quick and responsive.

#### BLOAT-FREE
Clear choices for optional dependencies will ensure a system that only contains what you ask for.

  <p><em>This part is important - who are we trying to attract? Lunar can be good for many people, but we need a focus. Can beginners install and maintain Lunar? Do we want developers and sysadmins looking for detailed control over their system? Users with older computers looking to optimize their system? Distro hoppers looking for something new? People tired of Gentoo? ;)</em></p>

<p><em>sample text below:</em></p>

<p>Lunar is a rolling-release, source-based Linux distribution. You begin by installing the <em>lunar core,</em> a minimal command-line only system, with the tools to build the full experience you want.</p>

<h4 id="stable">STABLE</h4>
<p>We use up-to-date software with very little changes from upstream. Our goal is a stable and robust system that won’t ever break on an update.</p>

<h4 id="flexible">FLEXIBLE</h4>
<p>Our <em>lunar</em> package management system is written entirely is bash, and it’s both powerful and easy to learn. Adding your own packages is a simple process.</p>

<h4 id="fast">FAST</h4>
<p>Hardware optimizations will make your system quick and responsive.</p>

<h4 id="bloat-free">BLOAT-FREE</h4>
<p>Clear choices for optional dependencies will ensure a system that only contains what you ask for.</p>

  <p>Lunar is a rolling-release, source-based Linux distribution for advanced users.</p>

<p>You begin by installing the <em>lunar core,</em> a minimal command-line only system, with the tools to build the full experience you want. From there, you create your own customized system built entirely from source code.</p>

<h4 id="stable">Stable</h4>
<p>We use up-to-date software with very little changes from upstream.</p>

<h4 id="flexible">Flexible</h4>
<p>Our <em>lunar</em> package management system is written entirely in Bash, and itâ€™s both powerful and easy to learn.</p>

<h4 id="fast">Fast</h4>
<p>Hardware optimizations will make your system quick and responsive.</p>

<h4 id="bloat-free">Bloat-free</h4>
<p>Clear choices for optional dependencies will ensure a system that only contains what you ask for.</p>

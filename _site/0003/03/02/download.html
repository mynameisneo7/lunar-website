  <p><em>How often should there be a release? It’s good to have a stable reference point, but the first time you ‘lunar update’, you’re effectively using the nightly. How old can it be before users don’t want to install it? Is it for the benefit of the users, or the developers?</em></p>

<p><em>sample text below:</em></p>

<p><strong>Lunar is a rolling-release distribution.</strong></p>

<p>You only need to need to install Lunar once, then update your system using the package manager. You’ll always have the latest version.</p>

<p>A release iso and a nightly iso are available. These provide the same programs as an installed and fully updated system on the day the iso was generated.</p>

<p>The release iso is known to be stable, and has been extensively tested. It will have older versions of <em>lunar core.</em>
The nightly iso has newer versions of our core programs, but has less quality testing and may not be as stable.</p>

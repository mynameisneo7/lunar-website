&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we need more than money is people willing to help out. Even if it’s small work like version bumps, every person who can contribute makes it easier for the dev team to make larger improvements. However, adding helpers will increase the work requirements of the devs unless we get users who can be trusted to make dev level decisions. If more people appear, there will need to be discussions how to effectively share the work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunar is a rolling-release distribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only need to need to install Lunar once, then update your system using the package manager. You’ll always have the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A release iso and a nightly iso are available. These provide the same programs as an installed and fully updated system on the day the iso was generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release iso is known to be stable, and has been extensively tested. It will have older versions of &lt;em&gt;lunar core.&lt;/em&gt;
The nightly iso has newer versions of our core programs, but has less quality testing and may not be as stable.&lt;/p&gt;

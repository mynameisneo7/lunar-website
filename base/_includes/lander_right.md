## A source-based, rolling-release distribution for advanced users.

Lunar Linux is a fully customizable _Stable_, _Fast_, and _Slim_ distribution
which can install software directly from source code. Choose an install image
for the correct architecture and have a minimal base system ready to build in
just a few minutes.

Tune your compiler optimizations, build and install the applications you want
with only those dependencies that you explicitly need, keeping your system fast,
lean, and very efficient.
